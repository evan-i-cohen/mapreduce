# mol-euler
Finds the eulerian path (if it exists) in a molecule given an input molecule in .xyz format
What needs to be implemented:
Give user the option to generate all confomers of a molecule and find the Eulerian paths of all the confomers ( if it exists).  Should be done using Apache Spark since python is bad with threads.
